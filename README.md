# inflationCalculator

This tool provides a simple inflation calculator for India based on a sample
Consumer Price Index (CPI) dataset. Select a starting and ending month/year to
see how much a given amount of money would be worth in another time period.

The CPI values are loaded dynamically from the `CPI-Jan13-To-May25.xlsx` file.
These values are approximate and meant for demonstration purposes only.

Open `index.html` in your browser to use the calculator.
