# inflationCalculator

This tool provides a simple inflation calculator for India based on a sample
Consumer Price Index (CPI) dataset. Select a starting and ending month/year to
see how much a given amount of money would be worth in another time period.

The CPI values included here are approximate and meant for demonstration
purposes only. In a real application you would replace `cpi-data.js` with
up-to-date official data.

Open `index.html` in your browser to use the calculator.
